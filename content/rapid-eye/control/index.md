**Rapid deployment CCTV control room** â€“ We have constructed a stand alone CCTV control room/command centre to get ready for the pending Martyns Law legislation to assist festival organizers to become compliant without the massive financial out lay at the onset of the festival/event.
We have worked alongside respected rapid deployment CCTV tower manufacturers to design our control room using Bot 5G and Starlink connectivity.
